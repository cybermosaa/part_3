                <h2> General Care Guidelines</h2>
                <p>
                    Immediately as you get home, try to wash the clothes - either hand wash or machine wash. 
                    Treat the items with gentle care. Air drying is your good friend as it helps maintain and 
                    extend the life of the item. You're not just keeping them in good shape, you're extending 
                    their journey with intention. Remember that proper care not only preserves your clothing 
                    but also honors the sustainable ethos of thrift fashion.

                    <h2> Knit</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hand wash cold and dry flat. Avoid hanging. The natural fibres of the wool will change 
                        the garment over time resulting in a brushed, textured finish. To restore the garment 
                        to its original state, use a pilling comb or fabric shaver. Store folded to maintain shape.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Denim</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cold hand wash separately, wash inside out. Color may transfer when new. We recommend 
                        hanging or folding the piece when storing and either ironing or steaming post wash. 
                        Use a soft detergent, avoid over-washing to extend the lifespan of your denim piece.

                    <h2>Cotton Items</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cold wash with mild detergent, and air dry or tumble dry on low heat. Avoid over-drying, 
                        and iron to remove wrinkles. Proper storage in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight, 
                        can also help extend the life of your cotton items.

                    <h2>Synthetic Fibers</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cold wash with mild detergent, and air dry or tumble dry on low heat. Avoid high temperatures 
                        as they can damage synthetic fibers. Turn garments inside out before washing to preserve color 
                        and texture.

                    <h2>Silk</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hand wash in cold water with mild detergent or use the delicate cycle. Never wring or twist silk. 
                        Hang to dry away from direct sunlight or lay flat. Iron while still damp on the lowest setting 
                        using a pressing cloth.

                    <h2>Delicate Fabrics</h2>
                    <p>
                        This includes lace and velvet. Cold wash with mild detergent. Hand wash is preferable. 
                        Hang to dry or lay flat. Use a cool iron or steam iron with a pressing cloth to prevent damage. 
                        Store carefully to avoid crushing delicate textures.
